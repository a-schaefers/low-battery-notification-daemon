* KISS power manager
Weighing in at ~80 lines of shell script, simple-power-manager tries to be a KISS (keep-it-simple-stupid) power manager.
By default it sends desktop notifications and adjusts brightness based on power threshholds, is easily programmable and
 can be copied and pasted directly in to .xinitrc.

* Easy customization

 Modify the user_custom functions accordingly in the comment block at the top of the script (shown below).

* Dependencies:
The "acpi" command is used to determine the current battery level

The "notify-send" command (libnotify) is used to send desktop notifications

The user_custom_batt_low() is configured for xbacklight/acpilight already-- users of lux, light or whatever will need to customize it.
