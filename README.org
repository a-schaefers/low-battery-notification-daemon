* KISS simple-power-manager
Weighing in at ~80 lines of shell script, simple-power-manager tries to be a KISS (keep-it-simple-stupid) power manager.
By default it sends desktop notifications and adjusts brightness based on power thresholds. Simple-power-manager
 can be thought of as a lightweight replacement for similar applications such as
xfce-power-manager and mate-power-manager.

* Install
Launch the script, or just copy and paste directly to .xinitrc.

* Easy customization

 Modify the user_custom functions accordingly in the comment block at the top of the script.

* Dependencies:
The "acpi" command is used to determine the current battery level

The "notify-send" command (libnotify) is used to send desktop notifications

The user_custom functions are configured for xbacklight/acpilight already--
users of lux, light or whatever will need to customize it.
