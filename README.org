* KISS power manager
Weighing in at ~70 lines of shell script, simple-power-manager tries to be a KISS (keep-it-simple-stupid) power manager.
By default it sends desktop notifications and adjusts brightness based on power threshholds, is easily programmable and
 can be copied and pasted directly in to .xinitrc.

* Easy customization

 Modify the user_custom functions accordingly in the comment block at the top of the script. (shown below)

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  user_custom_low_battery_hook() {
      if [ "$batt" -lt 21 ] && [ "$batt" -gt 10 ]; then
          # 10-20% percent battery
          notify-send "Battery: ${batt}%"
          xbacklight -set 20
      elif [ "$batt" -lt 11 ] && [ "$batt" -gt 5 ]; then
          # 5-10% percent battery
          notify-send "Battery: ${batt}%"
          xbacklight -set 10
          # If 5% battery or less
      elif [ "$batt" -lt 6 ]; then
          notify-send "Battery: ${batt}%"
          xbacklight -set 5
      fi
  }

  user_custom_battery_normal_hook() {
      # battery Charging / Full
      notify-send "Battery: $acpi_status ${batt}%"
      xbacklight -set 100
  }
#+END_SRC

* Dependencies:
The "acpi" command is used to determine the current battery level

The "notify-send" command (libnotify) is used to send desktop notifications

The user_custom_batt_low() is configured for xbacklight/acpilight already-- users of lux, light or whatever will need to customize it.
