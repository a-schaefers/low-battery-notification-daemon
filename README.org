* What
Weighing in at ~70 lines of code, this is my no-frills, POSIX shell power manager.
By default it sends desktop notifications and adjusts brightness based on power threshholds.

* How
The script can be copied and pasted directly in to .xinitrc.

Make sure to set the variables and user_custom functions accordingly in the comment block at the top of the script. (shown below)

    # battery polling frequency

    # battery % threshholds that trigger events

    user_custom_batt_low() {
        if [ "$batt" -lt 21 ] && [ "$batt" -gt 10 ]; then
            # 10-20% percent battery

            # If 5% battery or less - NOTE: consider running a suspend command
            notify-send "Battery: ${batt}%"
            xbacklight -set 5
        fi
    }
    # arbitrary code block that runs when the battery state changes to Charging or Full

    }

* Dependencies:
The "acpi" command is used to determine the current battery level

The "notify-send" command (libnotify) is used to send desktop notifications

The user_custom_batt_low() is configured for xbacklight/acpilight already-- users of lux, light or whatever will need to customize it.
